# Phpake

Phpake is a make-like utility built on PHP. It is pronounced the same as `fake`
because the second `p` is silent like in the world `elephpant`.

If you're working on a PHP project, most of your team members must already know some PHP.
I've always found writing a `Makefile` quite challenging because its syntax is similar to
the shell syntax, but it is very different at the same time!

When I was working with Ruby, I was using `rake` and it was awesome because it uses `ruby`
syntax. But when it comes to PHP, I often used to miss having a similar tool that is
easy to install and use. Thus, Phpake was born. I hope you like it and if you do, feel free
to leave a `$tip` ðŸ˜‰

## Development

This project uses a Dockerized development environment. Run the project as you would any
other docker-compose based project. There might be some handy commands in the `Makefile`.
